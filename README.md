# Eva-BotUI

An experiment with the [BotUI](https://github.com/botui/botui) JavaScript framework to prototype a conversational interface/chatbot for a project at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.

The conversation blocks I'm experimenting with can be found in *[/Eva-BotUI/js/conversation.js/](https://github.com/michelvanheest/Eva-BotUI/blob/master/js/conversation.js)*.
